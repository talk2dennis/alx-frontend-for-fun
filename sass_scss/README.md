# Sass & Scss
> ## CSS
> 
> This repository focuses on CSS, specifically on the front-end development aspect. It covers various topics related to Sass and Scss, from introductory concepts to advanced techniques.
> 
> ### What is Sass?
> 
> Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a preprocessor scripting language that is compiled into CSS. It provides additional features and functionalities that enhance the capabilities of CSS, such as variables, mixins, nesting, and more.
> 
> ### Why use Sass?
> 
> Sass offers several advantages over traditional CSS, including:
> 
> - **Modularity**: Sass allows you to break your stylesheets into smaller, reusable components, making your code more organized and maintainable.
> - **Code Reusability**: With Sass, you can define mixins and functions that can be reused across your stylesheets, reducing code duplication.
> - **Variables**: Sass introduces variables, which enable you to define and reuse values throughout your stylesheets, making it easier to update and maintain your styles.
> - **Nesting**: Sass allows you to nest selectors within one another, improving readability and reducing the need for repetitive code.
> - **Importing**: Sass provides the ability to import other Sass files, allowing you to split your stylesheets into smaller, manageable files.
> 
> ### Scss vs. Sass
> 
> There are two syntaxes available in Sass: Scss and Sass. Scss (Sassy CSS) is a superset of CSS, meaning that any valid CSS code is also valid Scss code. Sass, on the other hand, uses a more concise syntax with significant whitespace and no semicolons or curly braces.
> 
> In this repository, we will primarily be using the Scss syntax, as it is more widely adopted and easier for developers familiar with CSS to transition into.
> 
> ### Repository Contents
> 
> This repository contains a series of tasks and exercises that will guide you through the process of learning and applying Sass and Scss concepts. Each task is designed to build upon the previous one, gradually increasing in complexity and introducing new concepts along the way.
